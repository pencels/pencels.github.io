        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Christopher Pence. I go to school at UC San Diego, with
            a major in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics.
            Among my interests in CS are linguistics, drawing and graphic
            design.

            This summer (2016), I am working at the
            <a href="https://whizkidzcc.com/"> WhizKidz Computer Center</a> as
            an instructor in mainly web development and game development.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll hopefully have this website fleshed out sooner or later. Thank
            you, dear websurfer, for taking interest in my small place on the
            internet.
        </p>
