        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Christopher Pence. I go to school at UC San Diego with
            a major in Computer Science. Among my interests in CS are
            linguistics, drawing and graphic design.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of spring 2017, I work for the <a href="http://cse.ucsd.edu/">
            CSE Department</a> at UCSD, tutoring for CSE 30 (Computer
            Organization and Systems Programming). I started tutoring in
            <kbd>ARM</kbd> in the fall, and am doing <kbd>SPARC</kbd> now.<br>

            I am fascinated by low-level programming and all its intricacies,
            and can't wait to learn more about the stuff at the hardware-level
            this coming quarter! I'll also be taking a course in PL design,
            spooky.
        </p>

            Last summer (2016), I was working at the
            <a href="https://whizkidzcc.com/"> WhizKidz Computer Center</a> as
            an instructor in mainly web development and game development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll hopefully have this website better fleshed out sooner or later.
            Thank you, dear websurfer, for taking interest in my small place on
            the internet.
        </p>

            These are projects I am especially proud of, whether or not they may
            be finished.

        <p>
            Android app made for the CSE 110 software engineering course at
            UCSD. Provides a platform for UCSD student organizations to post
            events for students to find and RSVP to. I worked mainly on the
            back end, managing user authentication and database storage/access.

            The assembler for the Janus Instruction Set, a custom ISA developed
            with my friend @<a href="http://errs.io">errs.io</a>.

        <h2 class="project">

        <p>
            A "workbench" that facilitates writing proofs for proof-based
            classes. Won first place in the Education category at Hacktech '16.

        <p>
          Chatbot implemented at Hacktech '17 which takes user input and tries
          to learn to speak in a more "human" way. Written using a Wolfram back
          end, and React.
