        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Christopher Pence. I go to school at UC San Diego, with
            a major in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics.
            Among my interests in CS are linguistics, drawing and graphic
            design.

        As of winter 2017, I work for the <a href="http://cse.ucsd.edu/">
            CSE Department</a> at UCSD, tutoring for CSE 30 (Computer
            Organization and Systems Programming). I started with
            <kbd>ARM</kbd> in the fall, and am doing <kbd>SPARC</kbd> now.<br>

            I am fascinated by low-level programming and all its intricacies,
            and can't wait to learn more about the stuff at the hardware-level
            this quarter!
        </p>

            Last summer (2016), I was working at the
            <a href="https://whizkidzcc.com/"> WhizKidz Computer Center</a> as
            an instructor in mainly web development and game development.

            I'll hopefully have this website better fleshed out sooner or later.
            Thank you, dear websurfer, for taking interest in my small place on
            the internet.
