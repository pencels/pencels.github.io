# Hello there!
My name is Christopher Pence. Welcome to my personal site about me. I'm your average programmer who's super interested in programming language theory and compilers. I also like to game ([SSBU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate) anyone?) and draw on the side.

## What I'm doing now
I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft, developing services with cool tech like [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/overview) and [Azure Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/about-azure-maps).

## What I've done
I majored in Computer Science at UC San Diego from 2015-2019. During the academic year, I worked for the [CSE Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) as a tutor. I have tutored for:
+ `CSE 11`: Intro course taught in Java with a focus on OOP
+ `CSE 30`: Intro to low-level architecture with C and ARM assembly
+ `CSE 130`: Intro to PL theory with some functional programming (OCaml/Prolog)

During the summers (2016-2018), I worked at the [WhizKidz Computer Center](https://whizkidzcc.com/) as an instructor in web development, game development, and introductory courses to programming languages like Python and Java.

## Projects

### [slang](https://github.com/pencels/slang)
Slang is a neat little programming language that is strongly influenced by FP-style languages, namely Lisp and Scala. It's interpreted, _very_ dynamically typed, but pretty simple overall. The core part of slang is the "matchbox", a hybrid of a switch statement and a function. Almost everything in slang is defined with matchboxes ðŸ™‚ so watch out!

### [EventLIT](https://github.com/LIT-Chorus/EventLIT)
Android app made for the CSE 110 software engineering course at UCSD. Provides a platform for UCSD student organizations to post events for students to find and RSVP to. I worked mainly on the back end, managing user authentication and database storage/access.

### [jas](https://github.com/janus-cpu/janus-jas)
The assembler for the Janus Instruction Set, a custom ISA for a virtual machine developed with my friend [compiler-errors](https://github.com/compiler-errors/).

### [proofbuilder](https://github.com/chewisinho/proof-builder)
A "workbench" that facilitates writing proofs for proof-based classes. Won first place in the Education category at Hacktech '16.

### [Roboto or Notto](https://github.com/pencels/roboto-or-notto)
Chatbot implemented at Hacktech '17 which takes user input and tries to learn to speak in a more "human" way. Written using a Wolfram back end and a React front end.
