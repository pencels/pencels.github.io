# Hello there!
My name is Christopher Pence. I go to school at UC San Diego, majoring in Computer Science. I'm super interested in programming language theory and compilers.

During the academic year, I work for the [CSE Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. I have tutored for:
+ `CSE 11`: Intro course taught in Java with a focus on OOP
+ `CSE 30`: Intro to low-level architecture with C and ARM assembly
+ `CSE 130`: Intro to PL theory with some functional programming (OCaml/Prolog)

The last few summers (2016, 2017), I worked at the [WhizKidz Computer Center](https://whizkidzcc.com/) as an instructor in web development, game development, and introductory courses to programming languages like Python. I will be working here again this summer.

# Cool Things
These are projects I am especially proud of, whether or not they may be finished.

## [EventLIT](https://github.com/LIT-Chorus/EventLIT)
Android app made for the CSE 110 software engineering course at UCSD. Provides a platform for UCSD student organizations to post events for students to find and RSVP to. I worked mainly on the back end, managing user authentication and database storage/access.

## [jas](https://github.com/janus-cpu/janus-jas)
The assembler for the Janus Instruction Set, a custom ISA for a virtual machine developed with my friend [compiler-errors](https://github.com/compiler-errors/).

## [proofbuilder](https://github.com/chewisinho/proof-builder)
A "workbench" that facilitates writing proofs for proof-based classes. Won first place in the Education category at Hacktech '16.

## [Roboto or Notto](https://github.com/pencels/roboto-or-notto)
Chatbot implemented at Hacktech '17 which takes user input and tries to learn to speak in a more "human" way. Written using a Wolfram back end, and React.
