# Hello there!
My name is Chris. Welcome to my personal site about me. I'm your average programmer who's super interested in programming language theory and compilers. I also like to game ([DBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight) or [SSBU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate) anyone?) and draw on the side.

## What I've done

From 2019-2022, I worked as a software engineer at Microsoft, developing services with cool tech like [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/overview) and [Azure Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/about-azure-maps).


I majored in Computer Science at UC San Diego from 2015-2019. During the academic year, I worked for the [CSE Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) as a tutor. I have tutored for:
+ `CSE 11`: Intro course taught in Java with a focus on OOP
+ `CSE 30`: Intro to low-level architecture with C and ARM assembly
+ `CSE 130`: Intro to PL theory with some functional programming (OCaml/Prolog)

During the summers (2016-2018), I worked at the [WhizKidz Computer Center](https://whizkidzcc.com/) as an instructor in web development, game development, and introductory courses to programming languages like Python and Java.

## Projects

### [slang](https://github.com/pencels/rslang)
Slang is a neat little programming language that is strongly influenced by FP-style languages, namely Lisp and Scala. It's interpreted, _very_ dynamically typed, but pretty simple overall. The core part of slang is the "matchbox", a hybrid of a switch statement and a function. Almost everything in slang is defined with matchboxes ðŸ™‚ so watch out!

### [jas](https://github.com/janus-cpu/janus-jas)
The assembler for the Janus Instruction Set (JAS), a custom ISA for a virtual machine developed with my friend [compiler-errors](https://github.com/compiler-errors/).
