# Hello there!
My name is Chris. Welcome to my personal site about me. I'm your average programmer who's super interested in programming language theory and compilers. I also like to game ([DBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight) or [SSBU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate) anyone?) and draw on the side. I do a bit of [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/pencels) as well.

## What I've done

From 2019-2022, I worked as a software engineer at Microsoft, developing services with cool tech like [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/overview) and [Azure Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/about-azure-maps).


I majored in Computer Science at UC San Diego from 2015-2019. During the academic year, I worked for the [CSE Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) as a tutor. I have tutored for:
+ `CSE 11`: Intro course taught in Java with a focus on OOP
+ `CSE 30`: Intro to low-level architecture with C and ARM assembly
+ `CSE 130`: Intro to PL theory with some functional programming (OCaml/Prolog)

During the summers (2016-2018), I worked at the [WhizKidz Computer Center](https://whizkidzcc.com/) as an instructor in web development, game development, and introductory courses to programming languages like Python and Java.

## Projects

### [ticonderoga-bot](https://github.com/pencels-stationery-shop/ticonderoga)
Ticonderoga is the name I use for my personal Discord bot. When looking for a bot to moderate my own Discord server, I wasn't satisfied with the options out there &mdash; either they were full-featured but required a premium subscription, or they lacked features I wanted. So I decided to code and host my own!

### [crust](https://github.com/pencels/crust)
Crust is a low-level programming language I used as an exercise in learning [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). The name is a [portmanteau](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/portmanteau#Etymology_2) of the languages "C" and "Rust", as its goal is to match the level of complexity C has with the modernity of Rust syntax. 

### [slang](https://github.com/pencels/rslang)
Slang is a neat little programming language that is strongly influenced by FP-style languages, namely Lisp and Scala. It's interpreted, _very_ dynamically typed, but pretty simple overall. The core part of slang is the "matchbox", a hybrid of a switch statement and a function. Almost everything in slang is defined with matchboxes ðŸ™‚ so watch out!

### [jas](https://github.com/janus-cpu/janus-jas)
The assembler for the Janus Instruction Set (JAS), a custom ISA for a virtual machine developed with my friend [compiler-errors](https://github.com/compiler-errors/).
