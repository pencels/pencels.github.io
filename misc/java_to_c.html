            <h1>Java to C: A guide for prospective CSE 12 students.</h1>
            <p> Welcome! This is a guide I wrote in my spare time, and I
                hope it will serve you well in preparing for the
                rigorous course that is Gary’s CSE 12! </p>

            <div class="clear"></div>
            <p> Let's use a familiar program to help get a grasp of what's
                going on in C... </p>
            <h3>“Hello World” in Java</h3>
            <div class="clear"></div>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * Hello.java
 * ============
 * Look at this wonderful Java code (:
 */
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}</code></pre>

            <h3>“Hello World” in C</h3>
            <div class="clear"></div>
<pre><code class="language-c">/*
 * Hello.c
 * ============
 * C doesn't look that bad either!
 */
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p> The Java implementation should look familiar, so I’ll focus on the
            differences in the C code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no <code>class</code> definition.</li>
            <li>The <code>main</code> method has an <code>int</code> return type.</li>
            <li>C looks much less verbose (Sorry, Java).</li>
        </ul>
        <p> C actually has no <code>class</code> keyword, which is a result of
            it being an <em>action-oriented</em> language. This means that C
            focuses less on creating objects and more on defining functions to
            carry out actions. C programs are written mostly like the above—each
            method existing outside in the source code on its own. Despite being
            action-oriented, it still has the capability to create “objects,”
            but we’ll get into that later.
            </p>
        <p> C also includes the definition of .h (header) files, which are
            similar to Java’s interfaces: they provide a public interface
            for use of the actual .c source code. The benefit of using header
            files is that they promote data hiding and abstraction of code.</p>
        <p> The <code>int</code> return type is meant to indicate the
            <em>exit code</em> of the function. Usually, this is 0, indicating
            success (and why we return 0 at the end of <code>main</code>). The
            C’s <code>main</code> function also doesn't include <code>static</code>
            in its definition, since <code>static</code> has a different meaning
            in C from what it does in Java (more on that later).</p>
        <p> Finally, we can see that C looks simpler than Java in a few ways:
            we use <code>printf</code> instead of <code>System.out.println</code>
            and <code>int main</code> instead of <code>public static void main</code>.
            These simplifications come with a cost in the long run, since C more
            intensely requires the programmer to manage memory allocation than
            Java does.</p>

        <h2 id="Differences">Some more differences: </h2>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <h3 id="Pointers">Pointers</h3>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <p> Both C and Java use these, but C makes the programmer use them more
            explicitly. This means if you have experience with Java, you already
            have experience with pointers; you just didn’t know you were using
            them until now. </p>
        <p> Pointers really aren't that difficult to understand—they’re
            just variables that hold the address of other variables in memory.
            A common analogy to pointers are phone numbers: you keep
            someone’s phone number (i.e. their memory address) so that you can
            call them later (this is called ‘dereferencing’).</p>
        <p> Here's an example of pointer declaration and initialization next to
            a regular old integer declaration: </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* boring int declaration. */
int x = 42;

/* int pointer declaration! */
int * ptr;

/* int pointer initialized to point to x! */
int * xptr = &x;
</code></pre>
        <p> It's important to note the <code>*</code> which indicates that the
            variable is really a <em>pointer</em> to an <code>int</code>, not
            an <code>int</code> type itself (though on some systems the memory
            address held <em>is</em> a 32-bit integer value). </p>
        <p> You may also notice the <code>&</code> symbol on the third line.
            This is called the <em>address-of</em> operator, and it does exactly
            what its name says it does: it gets the address of the variable
            after it. </p>
        <p> Now the third line makes sense. The <em>int pointer</em>
            <code>xptr</code> is being assigned the address of <code>x</code>
            from line 1. If we continue our phone-number analogy, this is the
            same as saving someone’s phone number to your address book. Now
            that we have <code>x</code>’s phone number, how do we call them?
            Here's some more code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*xptr = 0; /* x is now 0 */
</code></pre>
        <p> Now the <code>*</code> symbol has a different use here. Here we call
            it the <em>dereference</em> operator. It follows the memory address
            saved in <code>xptr</code> to where <code>x</code> lives, then assigns
            the memory space there the value 0. In our phone analogy, this is
            the same as calling the person whose phone number you have. </p>
