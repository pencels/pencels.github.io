            <h1>Java to C: A guide for prospective CSE 12 students.</h1>
            <p> Welcome! This is a guide I wrote in my spare time, and I
                hope it will serve you well in preparing for the
                rigorous course that is Gary’s CSE 12! </p>

            <h2 id="Comparison">First, a comparison: </h2>
            <p> Let's use a familiar program to help get a grasp of what's
                going on in C... </p>

            <h3>“Hello World” in Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * Hello.java
 * ============
 * Look at this wonderful Java code (:
 */
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}</code></pre>

            <h3>“Hello World” in C</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">/*
 * Hello.c
 * ============
 * C doesn't look that bad either!
 */
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p> The Java implementation should look familiar, so I’ll focus on the
            differences in the C code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no <code>class</code> definition.</li>
            <li>The <code>main</code> method has an <code>int</code> return type.</li>
            <li>C looks much less verbose (Sorry, Java).</li>
        </ul>
        <p> C actually has no <code>class</code> keyword, which is a result of
            it being an <em>action-oriented</em> language. This means that C
            focuses less on creating objects and more on defining functions to
            carry out actions. C programs are written mostly like the above—each
            method existing outside in the source code on its own. Despite being
            action-oriented, it still has the capability to create “objects,”
            but we’ll get into that later.
            </p>
        <p> C also includes the definition of .h (header) files, which are
            similar to Java’s interfaces: they provide a public interface
            for use of the actual .c source code. The benefit of using header
            files is that they promote data hiding and abstraction of code.</p>
        <p> The <code>int</code> return type is meant to indicate the
            <em>exit code</em> of the function. Usually, this is 0, indicating
            success (and why we return 0 at the end of <code>main</code>). The
            C’s <code>main</code> function also doesn't include <code>static</code>
            in its definition, since <code>static</code> has a different meaning
            in C from what it does in Java (more on that later).</p>
        <p> Finally, we can see that C looks simpler than Java in a few ways:
            we use <code>printf</code> instead of <code>System.out.println</code>
            and <code>int main</code> instead of <code>public static void main</code>.
            These simplifications come with a cost in the long run, since C more
            intensely requires the programmer to manage memory allocation than
            Java does.</p>
